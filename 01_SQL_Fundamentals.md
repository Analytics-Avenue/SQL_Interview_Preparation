# SQL Introduction

## What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to **communicate with relational databases**.
It allows users to:
- Retrieve data
- Insert new data
- Update existing data
- Delete unwanted data

In simple words:
> SQL is how we talk to databases.

## Why SQL Exists
Before SQL:
- Data was scattered
- Retrieval was slow
- Every system had its own rules

SQL standardized data communication so businesses could:
- Store structured data
- Query it efficiently
- Maintain data integrity

---

## Real-World Example
If a manager asks:
> "Show me all customers who purchased last month"

SQL translates that request into an executable query.
